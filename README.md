# Tabarmageddon
Tabarmageddon is a Chrome extension.  
If the number of tabs exceeds the limit, tabs will get armageddon.  
**In the best case, half of tabs will be deleted randomly.**  
The default threshold is 20.  

Then, you can reflect about opening too many tabs and get motivated  
to have the habit of storing those pages in some bookmark services or private spaces.
